# Python Virtual Environment
# This is the most important exclusion. The venv directory contains all
# installed libraries but can be easily recreated by anyone using the
# requirements.txt file. It's machine-specific and very large.

# Python Cache Files
# Python generates these bytecode cache files and directories for
# performance. They are not part of the source code and will be
# regenerated automatically when the code is run.

# =========================================================================
# Project-Specific Generated Artifacts
# These files are created by running your setup scripts (e.g., ingest.py).
# Anyone cloning the project should generate these themselves, as per the
# instructions in the README.md. This ensures they are using the correct
# versions built on their own system.

# IDE and Editor Configuration Files
# These files store your personal workspace settings for editors like
# VS Code or PyCharm. They should not be in version control as other
# developers will have their own preferences.

# Operating System Files
# These files are generated by the operating system (e.g., macOS Finder)
# and have no place in a cross-platform source code repository.

# Testing and Coverage Reports
# If you run testing tools like pytest or generate coverage reports,
